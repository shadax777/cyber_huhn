* winter add-on:

  - new default weapon: snowball
    -> general: flying snowballs emit few snow flakes
    -> hostile snowballs hitting player make him shake a bit like plasma shots
    -> player's snowballs emit a lot of snow upon impacting enemies;
       NOTE: EC_CheckDamageParticles() should NOT be called, because snowballs
             can't cause debris.

  - snow flakes should fall down from heaven directly in front of the client
    (around the player; or at least in a half-sphere residing always in front
     of client's direction)
    we should make these snow flakes relatively large to give the illusion
    of many snow flakes though having only a few active

  - new weapon: ice-cannon (freezes enemies which will burst after 1-2 sec.)

* superchicken: lose cape upn hit and fall down :)

* implement accuracy bonus (this yields to a better competetion among players
  in the whole big bad world)
  -> print accuracy bonus at end of level (maybe insert between action + fade state)

* item: time-freezer

* display date + time of high-scores on web and in launcher

* option to adjust the ammount of particles (c.f. game opcode 
  GAME_PARTICLE_PERCENTAGE)

* shot models: animate to rotate around z-axis?

  also: "dir" vectors seems to be inverted
        (this is temporarily fixed in the game code, but no long-term solution)

* implement a hidden commandline switch to enable fps-display

* chickens with shawls, gloves and winter hats might look neat; also:
  a chicken dressed like Santa Claus.

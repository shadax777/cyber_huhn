  // just in case G_Free() was already called by G_EntitiesWorldClipping()
  // since the sound moved outside the world. that call to G_Free() already
  // explicitely caused the server to call entity_t->onSrvFree() (since
  // this func ptr was != NULL). so, we do not wanna have G_Free() called
  // twice on the same sound entity.
  // NOTE, that it is not 100%'ly clean to check the server entity if its
  // remove flag got set, because future versions of the server might
  // immediately remove the entity without marking it for removal.



  // We have to check if chicken's sound entity is still in use, because
  // world clipping might have freed it before freeing the chicken.
  // Without check, the chicken's sound entity will get freed a second
  // time now.

  /*
  Another issue arises if the looping sound flies a bit faster, then
  gets clipped before owner, but owner then still points to the freed sound
  entity: if the game code allocates a new entity (and that entity is the
  freed sound entity by chance!) between frames, the owner will
  fatefully point to the new entity, which is totally mess!

  Well, for the moment, the game code skips sound entities from freeing,
  but this is not correct!

  A better approach is to allow each entity to have 1 or 2 sound sources,
  directly connected to the sound engine.

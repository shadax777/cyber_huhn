A script consists of 3 different blocks:
	
	$level
	$entity
	$group

where the $level block is mandatory, $entity and $group blocks are optional
(but you will want to add some of these ;)).


Each block has different components, some of them are required, some are
optinal and some may only be present if others are not (XOR).

$level:
-------
	
	$title		- optinal
	$bgm		- optinal
	$duration	- required
	$sky		- required

$entity:
--------

	$spawntime		- required
	$respawnperiod	- optinal (negative values will never respawn the entity;
								if missing: also never respawn the entity)
	$name			- required
	$pos			- required
	$dir			- XOR $aim
	$aim			- XOR $dir
	$speed			- optional (default: 0; only non-negative values allowed!)

$group:
--------

	$spawntime		- required
	$respawnperiod	- optinal
	$pos			- required
	$dir			- XOR $aim
	$aim			- XOR $dir
	$speed			- optional (default: 0; only non-negative values allowed!)
	

You can put several entities into a group, inheriting the group's components
to each entity. The entity's components $spawntime, $pos, $dir, $aim and $speed
will then be set -relative- to the group. I.e. say, you have a group $pos
at "10 10 10" and set the $pos of one of the group's entities to "5 0 0" will
cause the entity to appear at { 15, 10, 10 } in the world.

Setting an entity's $spawntime to "2.0" while the surrounding group's 
$spawntime is "10.0" will spawn this entity after 12 seconds.

Same counts for $speed, $dir and $aim.

NOTE on the $dir component: the vector assigned to this component does not
  need to be normalized - it will be done for you.

NOTE: groups inside are are not (yet) suppoerted, you might receive a parse
  error.

NOTE: you will receive warnings if optinal components are missing, but that
  won't affect the compiler process


following entities can be scripted:

"chicken"
"superchicken"
"bombchicken"
"egg"
"ballon"
"racer01"
"racer02"
"enemy-ship"
"alien01"	// green
"alien02"	// red
"sonde"
"satellit"
"rakete"
"astronaut"
"komet"
"p01"	// planet
"p02"
"p03"
"p04"
"p05"
"p06"
"p07"
"skysphere01"
"skysphere02"	// MODEL MISSING - CAN'T SPAWN!
"skysphere03"	// MODEL MISSING - CAN'T SPAWN!
"skysphere04"	// MODEL MISSING - CAN'T SPAWN!
"skysphere05"	// MODEL MISSING - CAN'T SPAWN!
"skysphere06"	// MODEL MISSING - CAN'T SPAWN!
"skysphere07"	// MODEL MISSING - CAN'T SPAWN!

Usage:

scc <script> [options]

(type "scc" for command line options)

Scc truncates the filename's extension and adds '.bin'.
!! BEWARE: existing files will be overwritten without warning!!

The output directory can be set via "-outdir <dir>" which must exist.

If every is going fine, you won't get a message (i.e. "no news are good news" ;))
